# Dictionaries Unify
This is a simple web application, which try to unify the searching
              result of dictionary sites with different perspectives
              (definition, translation, usage, examples), to facilitate the
              learning process of a new vocabulary.
              
Library used:<br />
puppeteer: to capture screenshot of search result of different dictionary websites<br />
react-dnd: make window to be draggable for custom display<br />

This is the backend of the project, frontend: https://github.com/soldier13hk/dictsunify_frontend
